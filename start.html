    It is based on various libraries but not on a full rendering engine like
    Blink, Gecko or WebKit. The CSS layout engine is written in Python,
    designed for pagination, and meant to be easy to hack on. You can find the
    <a href="http://weasyprint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/features.html">list of supported features</a>
    on the dedicated chapter of the documentation.

    On Linux, installing can be as easy as:
  </p>

  <pre>
    <code>
|> pip install weasyprint
|> weasyprint https://weasyprint.org/ weasyprint.pdf</code>
  </pre>

  <p>
    WeasyPrint is also available as a library in a Python application,
    embedding in a website or an application is often straightforward. You can
    even use extra libraries dedicated to some famous Python web frameworks,
    such as <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-WeasyPrint/">Flask-WeasyPrint</a>
    or <a href="https://github.com/fdemmer/django-weasyprint">Django-WeasyPrint</a>.
