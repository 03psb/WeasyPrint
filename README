Dependencies
------------

Listed in setup.py, will install automatically if you use easy_install or pip:

 * html5lib
 * lxml
 * cssutils
 * Attest

Not listed in setup.py since they are either not on PyPI or tricky to compile.
You need to install these manually:

 * PyCairo
 * PyGTK
 * python-rsvg

About the PyGTK dependency
--------------------------

WeasyPrint does not use GTK+, but it uses Pango for text rendering. Pango can
work without GTK+, but its Python bindings are part of PyGTK.

When GObject introspection becomes usable for both Pango and cairo, we can
switch to those and drop the PyGTK dependency.
