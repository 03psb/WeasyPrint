Dependencies
------------

Listed in setup.py, will install automatically if you use easy_install or pip:

 * html5lib
 * lxml
 * cssutils
 * Attest

Not listed in setup.py since they are either not on PyPI or tricky to compile.
You need to install these manually:

 * PyCairo
 * PyGTK
 * python-rsvg

About the PyGTK dependency
--------------------------

WeasyPrint does not use GTK+, but it uses Pango for text rendering and rsvg for
SVG rendering. Both of them can work work without GTK+, but their Python
bindings either are part of PyGTK (for Pango) or depend on PyGTK (for rsvg).

If someday we have GObject introspection for all of Pango, rsvg and cairo
we can switch to those and drop the PyGTK dependency.

HTML parsing
------------

We use lxml to parse HTML into an object tree. lmxl’s own parser is very fast,
but it can optionnaly use the html5lib parser. html5lib implements the HTML5
parsing algorithm so it should give better results on broken HTML, though
“they all parse pretty-good HTML the same.” [1]
