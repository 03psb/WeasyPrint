WeasyPrint 0.11: floats, Acid2 and unprefixing
----------------------------------------------

WeasyPrint 0.11 is out.

It has not been long since 0.10, but the point of this release is to
finally merge the support for floats and clear that we have had for a
while in an experimental branch.

With this (and countless other bug fixes), WeasyPrint now passes the
Acid2 test! See the `details </#acid2>`_ or try it yourself::

And now for something completely different, the ``image-rendering``,
``transform``, ``transform-origin`` and ``size`` properties are unprefixed.
The prefixed form (eg. ``-weasy-size``) is ignored but gives a specific
warning.

You **will** need to change your stylesheets if you used any of these
with a prefix.


As usual, the details of less visible changes are in the `changelog
