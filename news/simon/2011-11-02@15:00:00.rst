WeasyPrint 0.1 is released
--------------------------

WeasyPrint finally got its first release!
It’s a rendering engine for HTML and CSS that produces PDF.

This 0.1 release has support for basic CSS2.1 without tables, floats or
absolute positioning. However it can already be useful for documents with
a “simple” layout.
