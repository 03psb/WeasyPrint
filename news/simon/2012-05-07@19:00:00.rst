WeasyPrint 0.8, tinycss and cssselect
-------------------------------------

Some `new features`_ as usual. The big one is *automatic layout* for tables.
Roughly, columns will get their width determined by the amount of content.

Other important but more underlying changes are tinycss_ and cssselect_.
tinycss is a new CSS parser I wrote from scratch as a smaller and faster
alternative to cssutils_. You can `read more about it`_ on my blog.
As to cssselect, I took over its maintenance after extracting it from lxml_.
It now supports most Level 3 selectors and can be extended more easily.
