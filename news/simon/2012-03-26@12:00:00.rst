WeasyPrint 0.4 to 0.7; BSD license
----------------------------------

I’ve been neglecting this “news” section for a while, and a lot has happened
since then.

Versions 0.4 to 0.7 of WeasyPrint have brought many `new features`_.
The big ones are Python 3 support, page headers and footers with page
counters, justified text, 2D transforms, and better page break control.
The list of `missing CSS 2.1 features`_ is shrinking visibly.

Features aside, and perhaps more importantly, the project is now BSD-licensed
starting from 0.7.1. (I did not bother to re-release the previous version
with the new license, but just ask if you need them.)
This less restrictive license will hopefully bring more users.

By the way, the project’s mailing-list_ is now up and running.
