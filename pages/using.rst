Using WeasyPrint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a standalone program
-----------------------

Once you have WeasyPrint `installed </install/>`_, you should have a
``weasyprint`` executable. You can just pass it the file name or the URL
of an HTML web page and the file name of the PDF or PNG file to write to.

For example::

    weasyprint http://weasyprint.org /tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf

You may see warnings about unsupported CSS on stderr.
Run ``weasyprint --help`` to see all available options.

As a Python library
-------------------

If youâ€™re writing Python code you can import and use WeasyPrint just like
any other Python library:

.. code-block:: python

    import weasy

    document = weasy.PDFDocument.from_file('http://weasyprint.org/')
    document.write_to('/tmp/weasyprint-website.pdf')

Which ``Document`` class you use determines the file format for the output.
Currently only PDF and PNG (in ``weasy.PNGDocument``) are supported.
These classes are instanciated with `HTML document parsed by lxml
<http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html#parsing-html>`_, but there are helpers
in the form of class methods. ``from_string`` takes a byte or Unicode string
while ``from_file`` can take an URL, a file name or a file-like object.

**TODO:** details for the ``Document`` API.
