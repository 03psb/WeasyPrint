title: "WeasyPrint 0.13: PyGTK compatibility"
---

0.13 will fall back on PyGTK if PyGObject 3 is not available.
This enables WeasyPrint to run and pass its tests on Debian Squeeze
(the current stable, as of this writing.)

Hopefully this will make WeasyPrint easier to install on more platforms
such as OS X. [Testers wanted](/community/)!
