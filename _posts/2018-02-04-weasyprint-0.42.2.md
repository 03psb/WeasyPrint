WeasyPrint 0.42.2 has been released.

Versions 0.42.x will only get simple bug fixes backported from the master
branch. New features, optimizations and complex bug fixes will only be added
to the 43+ versions that don't support Python 2 anymore.

Do not rely on future versions, development on the 0.x branch may be stopped at
any moment.

Bug fixes:

* [#560](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/560):
  Fix a couple of crashes and endless loops when breaking lines.
