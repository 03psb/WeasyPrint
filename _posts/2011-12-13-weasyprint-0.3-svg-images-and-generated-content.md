title: "WeasyPrint 0.3: SVG images and generated content"
---

New WeasyPrint release. The big features in 0.3 are SVG images and generated
content with the `:before` and `:after` pseudo-elements.
As usual, everything is in the [changelog](https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/blob/master/CHANGES).

To use the latest and greatest WeasyPrint, youâ€™ll need to upgrade
[cssutils](http://cthedot.de/cssutils/) to 0.9.8 and install
[CairoSVG](http://cairosvg.org/).
